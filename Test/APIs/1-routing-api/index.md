title: Routing API
---
Routing API provides a way to plan itineraries and query public transportation related
information about stops and timetables.

At first you should read our [GraphQL](./0-graphql/) and [GraphiQL](./1-graphiql/) pages and try out the examples provided.

You should also get familiar with our **“realtime arrival prediction”** before going any further.

After this, you are ready to run queries for routes, stops, bicycling routes, city bikes, disruption info and do itinerary planning.
