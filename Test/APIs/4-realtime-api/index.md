title: Real-time APIs
---

Our real-time APIs are not quite ready yet so they should be considered more like proofs of concept. We encourage you to try them out, but just keep that in mind.

At first you should read the [Real-time API getting started guide](./1-getting-started/) to better understand limitations and possibilities.

It is also recommended to read the pages below to get familiar with the real-time APIs:
* [service alerts](./service-alerts/) (HSL Alerts API that is used to query real-time updates about HSL fleet in GTFS-RT format)
* [trip updates](./trip-updates/) (Converts data from SIRI (Service Interface for Real Time Information) format to GTFS-realtime format)
* [vehicle positions](./vehicle-positions/) (Provides snapshot of the current real-time vehicle location data.)
