---
Routing API provides a way to plan itineraries and query public transportation related
information about stops and timetables.

At first you should read our [GraphQL](./0-graphql/) and GraphiQL guides below and try out provided examples.

You should also get familiar with our “realtime arrival prediction” before going any further.

After this, you are ready to do query about bicycles, routes, stops, and do itinerary planning.



OLD text (to be removed):

First, you should read [getting started](./1-getting-started/) guide and try out provided examples.

Then, read what ["realtime arrival prediction"](./2-realtime-arrival-prediction/) means.
