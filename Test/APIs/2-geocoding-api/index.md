title: Geocoding API
---
Unlike the routing API that uses GraphQL, the geocoding API is a traditional REST interface.

Geocoding API provides a way to perform address searches and address lookups (also known as reverse geocoding).

API is very simple, check examples for [Address lookup](./address-lookup/) or [Address search](./address-search/)
