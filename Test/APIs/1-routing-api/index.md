title: Routing API
---
Routing API provides a way to plan itineraries and query public transportation related
information about stops and timetables.

## Getting started

At first you should read the [GraphQL](./0-graphql/) and [GraphiQL](./1-graphiql/) pages and try out the examples provided.

It is also recommended to read the [Realtime arrival prediction](./2-realtime-arrival-prediction/) page before going any further.

After this, you are ready to run queries for routes, stops, city bikes and bicycling routes, disruption info and do itinerary planning.

| GraphiQL         Â                     | A simple UI for making queries. You can use it both to run queries and to explore the GraphQL schema.
| Realtime arrival prediction           | API queries can return real-time data for some vehicles. We know vehicle's planned route and it's current location. This information is used to predict when it actually arrives.
